To run a single [OmniFold](https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.182001) iteration just run:

```bash
cd scripts
python aleph.py
```

The number of iterations and other parameters are stored in the config file named ```config_omnifold.json```

The Unfolded results can be made using the plotting script:
